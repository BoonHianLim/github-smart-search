# GitHub Repository Smart Search üß†üîç

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that allows users to search for GitHub repositories using the GitHub API. It leverages OpenAI's language models to enhance search capabilities with features like keyword extraction, advanced filtering, and summarization of repository content.

## Features

- **Smart Search**: Extracts keywords from user queries using OpenAI's API and performs GitHub repository searches.
- **Advanced Filters**: Sort and filter repositories by stars, forks, issues, and more.
- **Summarization**: Summarizes README files of repositories using OpenAI's language models.
- **Repository Details**: View detailed information about a selected repository, including its README content.
- **Customizable API Credentials**: Supports OpenAI-compatible and Azure OpenAI endpoints.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BoonHianLim/github-smart-search.git
   cd github-smart-search
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux

   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Set your OpenAI API credentials in the sidebar.
3. Navigate between the following pages:
   - **Smart Search**: Extract keywords and search for repositories.
   - **Search**: Perform a direct search for repositories.
   - **Details**: View detailed information about a specific repository.

## File Structure
